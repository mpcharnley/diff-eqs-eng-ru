%If you plan to use it commercially (sell it for more than just
%duplicating cost), then you need to contact me and we will work something out.
%If you are printing a course pack for your students, then it is fine if the 
%duplication service is charging a fee for printing and selling the printed
%copy.  I consider that duplicating cost.
