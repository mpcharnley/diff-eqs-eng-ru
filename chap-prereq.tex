This chapter provides a review of some of the material from previous classes that 
may be a little rusty by the time one reaches differential equations. This can be used as a reference whenever 
these topics come up throughout the book. A lot of this material (or inspiration for it) is taken from the Precalculus book by Stitz and Zeager \cite{SZ}.
