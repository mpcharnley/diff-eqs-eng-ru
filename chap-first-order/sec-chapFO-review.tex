\begin{exercise}
Bernoulli the snail slithers along a tabletop measuring 20 inches across, starting at one edge with a remarkable speed of 4 inches per hour. Bernoulli is afraid of falling off the other edge of the table---as you would be too if you were a snail. Accordingly, he slows down so that {\it the speed of the snail is proportional to the square of the distance remaining}. How long will it take Bernoulli to get halfway across the table? %1.3
